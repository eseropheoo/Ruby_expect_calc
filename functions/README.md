# SPARTA Functions Lab

## Timings - 60 Min 

## Summary 

Using what you have learnt already, work through  the startercode and create the relevate function for each task. You should try and be as independant as you can for this task however you have the internet at your disposal. 

To mesure your progress, you will notice there is a ```spec``` directory in the starercode. To run these tests, make sure you're in the correct directory and run the following command: 

```
rspec functions_spec.rb
```

The first time you run this command you will notice all the tests report RED. Dont worry, this is normal. As you work through each task, more tests will pass.
